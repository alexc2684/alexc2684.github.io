    About Me
  </h1>
  <p>
    My name is Alex and I am studying computer science at UC Berkeley. I see
    computer science as a highly diverse and fascinating subject. My current
    interests include optimizing systems and machine learnin. I'm passionate
    about learning and hope to explore all different areas of CS and how they
    apply to other fields of study. I am currently working as junior specialist
    software developer at CellScope, which aims to detect diseases at the
    cellular level using a convolutional neural network.

    In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar and playing pickup basketball.
    I am passionate about finding new music, coffee, and recently a fascination
    in art.
