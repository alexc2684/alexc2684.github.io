  My name is Alex and I am studying computer science at UC Berkeley. I see
  computer science as a highly diverse and fascinating subject. My current
  interests include optimizing systems and machine learning. I'm passionate
  about learning and hope to explore all different areas of CS and how they
  apply to other fields of study. I am currently working as junior specialist
  software developer at CellScope, which aims to detect diseases at the
  cellular level using a convolutional neural network.

  In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar and playing pickup basketball.
  I am passionate about finding new music, coffee, and a recently discovered
  fascination in art.
